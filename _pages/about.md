I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research at Virginia Tech, working under the guidance of [Dr. Manish Bansal](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/bansal.html){:target="_blank"}. 
My research focuses on addressing stochastic optimization problems with applications in areas such as network optimization, network vulnerability analysis, and attacker-defender games (e.g., interdiction models). I am particularly passionate about developing efficient algorithms for stochastic mixed-integer programs, distributionally robust mixed-integer programs, and distributionally risk-receptive (optimistic) optimization problems.

## Research Interests
- Stochastic programming
- Mixed-integer programming
- Distributionally robust optimization and distributionally risk-receptive optimization
- Network optimization
- Network interdiction problem (Attacker-defender network optimization)
- Transportation and logistics optimization problems
- Graph neural network
